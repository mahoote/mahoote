### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm currently working on an exciting project: a drinking game tool designed to create the ultimate night of fun. It tailors activities and games based on player preferences, like how drunk or active you want to beâ€”ensuring every game night is unforgettable!

Feel free to explore my previous projects, and I hope you enjoy what you find here.
